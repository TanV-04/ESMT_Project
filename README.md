# Music Composition with Deep Learning

This project focuses on generating simple tunes using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a single MIDI dataset to compose music. The project is built as part of our college MATLAB elective curriculum.

## Features

- Generates basic music compositions based on a trained model.
- Uses Deep Learning Toolbox and Audio Toolbox within MATLAB to understand patterns in music data (MIDI files).
- Built using MATLAB to leverage its powerful computational and visualization tools.
- Provides a starting point for anyone interested in experimenting with deep learning for music generation.
