# Music Composition with Deep Learning

This project focuses on generating simple tunes using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a single MIDI dataset to compose music. The project is built as part of our college MATLAB elective curriculum.

## Features

- Generates basic music compositions based on a trained model.
- Uses Deep Learning Toolbox and Audio Toolbox within MATLAB to understand patterns in music data (MIDI files).
- Built using MATLAB to leverage its powerful computational and visualization tools.
- Provides a starting point for anyone interested in experimenting with deep learning for music generation.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanV-04/ESMT_Project.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd ESMT_PROJECT

3. **Install MATLAB** and ensure that **Deep Learning Toolbox** and **Audio Toolbox** are available

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset: Download a MIDI dataset preferably from: https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro#v300

2. Run the music_composition.m script.

3. A Windows Music Player window will open up.
